* getting the last element
* adding at the last element
* adding at the first position
* adding / inserting at a specific position
* check if the list contains a specific element

## 1.00 

Create the interface for the basic operations with no dependencies and type d
efinitions.

## 1.01

Abstract data type `list_t` defined.

The abstract data type `list_t` will be used, created, and operated on by the 
function implementation of each of the concrete data types.

## 1.02

List type implementation basic implementation.

Basic implementation of `list_implementation` and `list_intf` done. Stub 
implementation of a concrete data type array list in thourgh `ARRAYLIST_T` or
`&arraylist_implementation`.
